# 🏙️ Urban Development & Public Sentiment Analytics Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This project delivers a comprehensive urban analytics dashboard designed to help municipal governments:
- Optimize resource allocation
- Improve public services
- Understand citizen sentiment in real time

By integrating 311 service requests, public transport data, and social media sentiment, the dashboard provides actionable insights for city planners.

---

## ❓ Problem Statement
City planners often rely on outdated census data and anecdotal feedback, leading to inefficient resource distribution and poor responsiveness to citizen needs.

**This project aims to:**
- Aggregate diverse urban datasets
- Visualize problem hotspots
- Correlate public sentiment with service performance
- Enable data-driven decision-making

## 🗂️ Data Sources
| Dataset           | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| `311_ServiceRequests` | Non-emergency complaints with geolocation, type, priority, and status |
| `SentimentData`       | Social media sentiment scores and topics |
| `PublicTransport`     | Transit ridership, delays, and mode data |
| `UrbanAnalysis`       | Aggregated metrics across neighborhoods |
| `Date`                | Time dimension for filtering and analysis |

## 📆 Weekly Breakdown

### Week 1 – Data Integration & Geospatial Modeling
- Cleaned and mapped 311 data
- Integrated shapefiles into Power BI
- Created heatmaps of complaint hotspots

### Week 2 – Service Requests & Sentiment Analysis
- Scraped and scored social media sentiment
- Built dashboards for complaint types and resolution times
- Overlaid sentiment data on complaint maps

### Week 3 – Transit Performance & Sentiment Correlation
- Visualized ridership and delays
- Linked negative sentiment to transit issues
- Used Key Influencers to identify drivers of dissatisfaction

### Week 4 – Resource Allocation & Needs Analysis
- Compared resource availability vs. complaint volume

- Visualized trends and resource gaps
- Delivered a printable one-page report for stakeholders

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- High complaint areas (Downtown, Midtown) lacked sufficient resources
- Transit delays strongly correlated with negative sentiment
- Uptown and SoHo were underserved despite high complaint volumes

---

## ✅ Recommendations
- Prioritize high-complaint, low-resource neighborhoods
- Improve transit reliability to boost public sentiment
- Align resource allocation with real-time needs

---
